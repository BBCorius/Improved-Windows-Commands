# Improved-Windows-Commands
Improved Windows Command Prompt commands (includes installers)

## About
A compilation of custom commands made by me. These custom commands are made to ease [batch scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file) by turning long scripts into commands. All programmed in [batch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file) and compiled into EXE (ask me for the source code).

## Requirements
1. Windows 7 to Windows 10 (it may work on Windows XP but some commands might not work)
2. [Windows Powershell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases) (already preinstalled for Windows 10)

# Installation
You can find an installer for every individual command in it's respective folders. Since I am still adding more commands, there isnt an installer to install all commands yet.
