# Improved-Windows-Commands
Improved Windows Command Prompt commands (includes installers)

## About
A compilation of custom commands made by me. These custom commands are made to ease batch scripting by turning long scripts into commands. All programmed in batch and compiled into EXE (ask me for the source code).

## Requirements
1. Windows 7 to Windows 10 (it may work on Windows XP but some commands might not work)
2. Windows Powershell

# Installation
You can find an installer for every individual command in it's respective folders. Since I am still adding more commands, there isnt an installer to install all commands yet.
